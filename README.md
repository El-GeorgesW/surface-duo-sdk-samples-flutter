# Surface Duo Flutter samples

This repo contains Flutter samples with enhancements for the Microsoft Surface Duo.

The [design_patterns](https://github.com/microsoft/surface-duo-sdk-samples-flutter/tree/master/design_patterns/) project shows how to build the [dual-screen design patterns](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/introduction#dual-screen-app-patterns)

The [hinge_angle](https://github.com/microsoft/surface-duo-sdk-samples-flutter/tree/master/design_patterns/lib/hinge_angle) project shows how to use the hinge angle data provided by the [dual_screen](https://pub.dev/packages/dual_screen) flutter package.

More information, including design resources can be found in the [dual-screen docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/). All the screenshots are generated using the [Surface Duo emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/dual-screen/android/emulator/).
